<h1 id="manual">Manual</h1>

<p>Welcome to Tauon Music Box.</p>

<p>Tauon is a playlist oriented music player that makes that assumption that folders are albums.
  (You may find the words "album" and "folder" used interchangeably withing the interface and documentation)</p>

<p>While some features and interface elements may not be immediately intuitive, I hope
  that once you are a familiar, you will find that Tauon is pleasant, fun and fast to use!</p>

<p>When you launch Tauon for the first time, you should be greeted with the main window that looks something like this:</p>

<img src="t01.png" alt="Emtpy main window" width="700">

<h2 id="importing tracks" class="manual-title" >Importing tracks</h2>

<p>To import tracks, simply <strong>drag and drop</strong> files or folders from your file manager into the main tracklist area.</p>

<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To get started, try import all your music into the single playlist.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have tracks imported, just <em>double click</em> them to play.</p>

<h3>Updating</h3>

<p>Tauon has no background file monitoring. To update, simply clear the playlist and re-import.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the first folder you ever imported to a playlist was a top level folder,
  you can activate "Rescan Folder" from the playlist tab context menu.</p>

<h2 id="top panel" class="manual-title">Playlist navigation</h2>

<img src="t03.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the top panel">

<p>The top panel contains the playlist tabs. Click a playlist tab to switch the tracklist view to that playlist. You can also <strong>mouse wheel scroll</strong> to cycle through them.</p>

<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Playback from any original started playlist will still continue.</p>
</div>

<p>You can create a <strong>new empty playlist</strong> by clicking MENU, then clicking "New Playlist".</p>

<p>You can <strong>delete</strong> a playlist by <strong>middle mouse clicking</strong> on the playlist tab you want to delete.</p>

<p>You can <strong>drag tracks</strong> from the main tracklist and drop them onto a playlist tab to add them to the end of that playlist. Also, if you drag and drop tracks to the right of all the playlist tabs,
this will create a new playlist of those tracks.</p>

<p>You can <strong>drag playlist tabs</strong> to re-arrange them. Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to merge one playlist onto the end of another.
  Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while dragging to the right of all the tabs to create a duplicate of that playlist.</p>



<h2 id="bottom panel" class="manual-title">The bottom panel</h2>

<img src="t06.jpg" alt="The bottom panel" class="manual-title" width=800>

<p>Starting from the left:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Play button</strong>.
    <div class="tip">
    <p><strong>Feature:</strong> <em>Right click</em> the play button to <em><strong>go to playing</strong></em>. This will locate the currently playing track in the tracklist.
    The playlist will be switched if nessesary, <strong>however</strong> if there is another matching track in the currently viewed playlist, it will be located and set to be the playing track instead.
  (This is useful for example, if you were playing a single track from a shuffled playlist, and you then wanted to continue playback from the full album that resides in another playlist.)</p>
    </div>
  </li>
<li><strong>Pause button</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stop button</strong>. You can right click this to activate auto-stop, which will automatically stop when the end of the current track is reached.</li>
<li><strong>Previous button</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Next button</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Feature:</strong> Next and Previous normally play songs as they appear in the playlist.
However with shuffle mode on, Previous plays tracks from playback history.</p>
</div>

<p>Staring from the bottom right:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Playback time indicator</strong>. You can click this to cycle available display modes: Time elapsed, Time remaining, Elapsed + track length and Album elapsed + album length.</li>
  <li><strong>Volume bar</strong>. You can right click to mute.</li>
  <li><strong>Playback menu</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Shuffle toggle</strong>. You can right click to access the shuffle menu.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat toggle</strong>. You can right click to access the repeat menu.
  <div class="tip">
  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to shuffle tracks within a single album, activate both <em>Repeat Album</em> and standard shuffle.
    (Maybe you're playing <a href="https://eluvium.bandcamp.com/album/shuffle-drones">this</a> album.) Or you could always just drag and drop to a new playlist and enable shuffle.</p>
  </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Along the top is the <strong>seek bar</strong>. You can <em>middle mouse click</em> this to bring up a time cursor.</p>

<h2 id="right side panel" class="manual-title">The right side panel</h2>

<p>On the top half of the side panel is the <strong>album art display</strong>.
Left click the album art to cycle through any available images.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> while mousing over the album art will tell you the image resolution.</p>
</div>

<p>On the bottom half is track metadata. If you right click here, this will bring up the <strong>lyrics menu</strong>. Once the "Show lyrics" menu entry is clicked, the right side panel will
  automatically switch to lyrics layout when lyrics are available.<p>

<p>You can <strong>resize</strong> the panel by dragging the left edge.</p>

<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Resize the panel far left for a large album art style layout.</p>
<img src="t02.png" alt="Side panel with full sized art" width="500">
<p><small>Album on show here is <a href="https://music.midwestcollective.us/album/odyssey">https://music.midwestcollective.us/album/odyssey</a></small></p>
</div>

<p>You can also toggle between an alternate <em>centered style</em> layout by <strong>middle mouse clicking</strong> in the side panel.</p>


<h2 id="gallery" class="manual-title">Gallery view</h2>

<img src="g01.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the gallery view" width=700>

<p>You can enter the gallery either by clicking MENU, then clicking the gallery layout icon (2nd from the top).
  <strong>or</strong> by pressing <strong>mouse button 4</strong> (the one closer to you) on a 5 button mouse.
</p>

<p>You can also enter the gallery in a "keyboard control mode" by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd></p>

<p>To play an album, just click it. This is a single click by default but you can change it to a double click in settings if you want.</p>


<h2 id=tracklist class="manual-title">The tracklist</h2>

<h4>Re-arranging tracks</h4>

<p>As mentioned previously, you can drag tracks (or a group of tracks) to another
  playlist by dragging and dropping. You can also <strong>drag to re-arrange</strong> tracks
  within a playlist if you hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> then drag. (Note that moving a group doesn't require shift)</p>

<h4>Scrolling</h4>

<p>You can scroll using the mouse wheel.</p>

<p>There is also a <strong>scroll-bar</strong> hidden to the left of the playlist until you mouse over.
  In the scroll bar you can hold down the mouse button above or below the grip to scroll quickly in that direction.
  You can also <em>right click</em> to jump to an absolute position within the scroll field. </p>



<h2 id="left side panel" class="manual-title">The left side panel</h2>

<p>To toggle the left side panel, click the far <strong>top-left corner button</strong>.</p>
<p>The left side panel has multiple available views. To switch between them, right click the toggle button to bring up a menu that lists the other views.</p>

<h3 id="playlsts+queue" class="manual-title">Playlists + Queue (Left side panel)</h3>

<p>As you create more playlists, there won't be enough room for them all on the top panel. This "Playlists + Queue" view lists all your playlists.</p>

<img src="t04.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the playlist list">

<p>These tabs behave similar to the top panel tabs. There is a <em>toggle switch</em> to the left of the playlist title that allows you to <em><strong>unpin</strong></em> a tab from the top panel.</p>

<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Just keep tabs <em>Pined</em> when you want quick access to them.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="artist list" class="manual-title">Artist List (Left side panel)</h3>

<p>This layout lists artists from the current playlist. See <a href="https://github.com/Taiko2k/TauonMusicBox/wiki/Artist-list">here</a> for details.</p>

<h3 id="folder navigator" class="manual-title">Folder Navigator (Left side panel)</h3>

<p>This view lists folders in the current playlist.<p>

<img src="t05.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the folder navigator">

<p><strong>Double click</strong> a folder to play. <strong>Single click</strong> to simply locate that folder in the playlist.</p>


<p>If there are sub-folders in your collection, this will be presented in a tree style layout.
  Note that this doesn't directly represent folders on your filesystem, but rather it tries to intelligently list only relevant nodes of the folder structure of tracks you already imported.</p>


<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you have a large music collection, you <em>could</em> consider keeping your collection divided in separate sub-folders based on, for example, different genres. This will allow you to navigate your
music collection more easily using the folder navigator.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> In the <em>right click</em> context menu of a node level folder, there's an option named "Move playing folder here". Note that this is a <strong>physical</strong> move of
the folder of the playing track to the selected folder on disk. The folder will be placed in an additional sub-folder that has the name of the <strong>artist</strong> of the album. (Folder will be created if it does not exist.)</p>

<p>This feature is useful if you have multiple library locations you want to transfer albums between, or between different sub folders such as suggested in the above tip.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="search" class="manual-title">Global search</h2>

<p>This search complies different types of results from all playlists. It will automatically activate when you start typing.</p>

<p>Clicking an Artist, Genre or Folder result will create a new playlist of the result. Clicking a Track or Album result will play it.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Right clicking</em></strong> any result will simply <strong>locate</strong> the result instead of playing or creating a new playlist. </p>
<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + clicking will add the result to the current playlist without closing the search screen</p>

<h2 id="find" class="manual-title">Quick find</h2>

<p>The find box locates tracks within the currently viewed playlist.</p>

<p>To use the find box, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> and type search terms, then use UP and DOWN arrow keys to jump
  to next and previous results in the playlist.</p>

<div class="tip">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to create a new playlist of all matching results.</p>

<p>This can be useful for example, finding artists in features or filenames that may not be picked up by the global search.<br>
  Since this also searches the filename, you can use this to create a playlist of tracks of a single file type, for example searching <code>.ogg</code>
</p>
</div>


<h2 id="mini" class="manual-title">Mini Mode</h2>

<p><small>Album on show here is <a href="https://illeniumashes.bandcamp.com/album/ashes">https://illeniumashes.bandcamp.com/album/ashes</a></small></p>

<img src="t07.png" width="250px">


<p>To enter Mini-mode, double click in the area under the seek bar of the main window.</p>

<p>You can switch to different styles by right clicking in the same area under the seek bar and selecting an option from the menu.</p>

<p>While in mini mode, you can <strong>pause</strong> by <em>right clicking</em>.</p>

<h2 id="backends" class="manual-title">Audio backends</h2>

<p>Currently, Tauon supports two different audio backends you can choose from in the Audio settings: <strong>BASS</strong> and <strong>GStreamer</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>BASS is closed-source/proprietary while GStreamer is open-source/free software.</li>
  <li>Tauon currently has more feature implementation with BASS. (Visualisers, Outbound broadcasting)</li>
  <li>One or the other may perform better on your setup. However, BASS tends to perform better generally.</li>
</ul>
