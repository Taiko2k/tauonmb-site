        <p>Reading the below manual is highly recommended to get the most out of Tauon Music Box.</p>

<div class="content">

    <h1 id="manual">Manual</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Tauon Music Box!</p>

    <p>Tauon is a playlist oriented music player that makes that assumption that folders are albums.
        (You may find the words "album" and "folder" used interchangeably within the interface and documentation)</p>

    <p>While some features and interface elements may not be immediately intuitive, I hope
        that once you are a familiar, you will find that Tauon is pleasant, fun and fast to use!</p>

    <p>When you launch Tauon for the first time, you should be greeted with the main window that looks something like
        this:</p>

    <img src="t01.png" alt="Emtpy main window" width="700" usemap="#mainmap">

    </map>

    <p><small>Click a region in the screenshot above to go to that section of the manual</small></p>

    <h2 id="importing tracks" class="manual-title">Importing tracks</h2>

    <p>To import tracks, simply <strong>drag and drop</strong> files or folders from your file manager into the main
        tracklist area.</p>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> To get started, try import all your music into the single playlist.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Once you have tracks imported, just <em>double click</em> them to play.</p>

    <h3>Updating</h3>

    <p>Tauon has no background file monitoring. To update, simply clear the playlist and re-import.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can trigger a rescan of all top level folders you've previously added by selecting "Rescan Folders"
        from the playlist tab context menu.</p>

    <h2 id="top panel" class="manual-title">The top panel + playlist navigation</h2>

    <img src="t03.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the top panel">

    <p>The top panel contains the playlist tabs. Click a playlist tab to switch the tracklist view to that playlist. You
        can also <strong>mouse wheel scroll</strong> to cycle through them.</p>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Playback from any originally started playlist will still continue from that playlist.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You can create a <strong>new empty playlist</strong> by clicking MENU, then clicking "New Playlist".</p>

    <p>You can <strong>delete</strong> a playlist by <strong>middle mouse clicking</strong> on the tab of the playlist.</p>

    <p>You can <strong>drag tracks</strong> from the main tracklist and drop them onto a playlist tab to add them to the
        end of that playlist.</p>
    <p>If you drag and drop tracks to the right of all the playlist tabs,
        this will create a new playlist of those tracks.</p>

    <p>You can <strong>drag tabs</strong> to re-arrange them. Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to merge one playlist onto
        the end of another.
        Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while dragging to the right of all the tabs to create a duplicate of that playlist.</p>


    <h2 id="bottom panel" class="manual-title">The bottom panel</h2>

    <img src="t06.jpg" alt="The bottom panel" class="manual-title" width=800>

    <p>Starting from the left:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Play button</strong>.
            <div class="tip">
                <p><strong>Feature:</strong> <em>Right click</em> the play button to <em><strong>go to playing</strong></em>.
                    This will locate the currently playing track in the tracklist.
                    The playlist will be switched if necessary, <strong>however</strong> if there is another matching
                    track in the currently viewed playlist, it will be located and set to be the playing track instead.
                    (This is useful for example, if you were playing a single track from a shuffled playlist, and you
                    then wanted to continue playback from the full album that resides in another playlist.)</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pause button</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Stop button</strong>. Right click to activate auto-stop, which will stop
            playback when the end of the current track is reached.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Previous button</strong>. Right click toggles repeat.</li>
        <li><strong>Next button</strong>. Right click toggles shuffle.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Next and Previous normally play songs in the order they appear in the tracklist.
            However with shuffle mode on, Previous plays tracks from playback history.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Staring from the bottom right:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Playback time indicator</strong>. You can click this to cycle available display modes: Time elapsed,
            Time remaining, Elapsed + track length and Album elapsed + album length.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Volume bar</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Playback menu</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Shuffle toggle</strong>. You can right click to access the shuffle menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat toggle</strong>. You can right click to access the repeat menu.
            <div class="tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to shuffle tracks within a single album, activate both <em>Repeat
                    Album</em> and standard shuffle.
                    (Maybe you're playing <a href="https://eluvium.bandcamp.com/album/shuffle-drones">this</a> album.)
                    Or you could always just drag and drop tracks to a new playlist and then enable shuffle.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Along the top is the <strong>seek bar</strong>. You can <em>middle mouse click</em> this to bring up a time
        cursor.</p>

    <h2 id="right side panel" class="manual-title">The right side panel</h2>

    <p>On the top half of the side panel is the <strong>album art display</strong>.
        Click the album art to cycle through any available images.</p>
    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> while placing the mouse cursor over the album art will tell
            you the image resolution.</p>
    </div>

    <p>On the bottom half is track metadata. If you right click here, this will bring up the <strong>lyrics
        menu</strong>. If the "Show lyrics" entry in the menu is enabled, the right side panel will
        automatically switch to lyrics layout when lyrics are available.
    <p>

    <p>You can <strong>resize</strong> the panel by dragging the left edge.</p>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Resize the panel toward the left for a large album art style layout.</p>
        <img src="t02.png" alt="Side panel with full sized art" width="500">
        <p><small>Album on show here is <a href="https://music.midwestcollective.us/album/odyssey">https://music.midwestcollective.us/album/odyssey</a></small>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>You can also toggle between an alternate <em>centered style</em> layout by <strong>middle mouse clicking</strong>
        in the side panel.</p>


    <h2 id="shortcuts" class="manual-title">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

    <p>Here's some of the important shortcuts and their defaults:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><kbd>Space</kbd></td>
            <td>Play/pause</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><kbd>-</kbd> / <kbd>+</kbd></td>
            <td>Seek</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><kbd>Left</kbd> / <kbd>Right</kbd></td>

    <p>For a more complete list, see <a href="https://github.com/Taiko2k/TauonMusicBox/wiki/Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="out-contents-link">here</a>.

    <p>You can edit key-binds in the input.txt file in the user data folder. You can find this folder by going to MENU > "Settings..." then pressing "Open data folder".</p>

    <h2 id="gallery" class="manual-title">Gallery view</h2>

    <img src="g01.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the gallery view" width=700>

    <p>You can enter the gallery either by clicking MENU, then clicking the gallery layout icon (2nd from the top)
        <strong>or</strong> by pressing <strong>mouse button 4</strong> (the one closer to you) on a 5 button mouse.
    </p>

    <p>You can also enter the gallery in a "keyboard control mode" by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd></p>

    <p>To play an album, just click it. This is a single click by default but you can change it to a double-click in
        settings if you prefer by going MENU > Settings... > View and un-checking "Single click to play".</p>


    <h2 id=tracklist class="manual-title">The tracklist</h2>

    <h4>Selecting and re-arranging tracks</h4>

    <p>You can select a single track by clicking on it <strong>or</strong> you can select an album block by clicking its
        title in the tracklist.
        You can also select a range by clicking the first track then holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> and clicking the last
        track.</p>

    <p>You can move/add tracks in a playlist by drag and drop or copy and paste.</p>

    <div class="tip"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Using paste from the context menu will add tracks at the end of the album
        block of the selected track.
        Using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> shortcut will add them to the end of the viewed playlist.</p></div>

    <div class="tip"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Moving a single track requires holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> when dragging.
    </p></div>

    <h4>Scrolling</h4>

    <p>You can scroll using the mouse wheel.</p>

    <p>There is also a <strong>scroll-bar</strong> hidden to the left of the tracklist until you mouse over.
        In the scroll bar you can hold down the mouse button above or below the grip to scroll quickly in that
        direction.
        You can also <em>right click</em> to jump to an absolute position within the scroll field. </p>


    <h2 id="left side panel" class="manual-title">The left side panel</h2>

    <p>To toggle the left side panel, click the far <strong>top-left corner button</strong>.</p>
    <p>The left side panel has multiple available views. To switch between them, right click the toggle button to bring
        up a menu that lists the other views.</p>

    <h3 id="playlsts+queue" class="manual-title">Playlists + Queue (Left side panel)</h3>

    <img src="t04.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the playlist list">
    <p>This "Playlists + Queue" view lists all of your playlists. These tabs behave similar to the top panel tabs. You
        can choose to <em><strong>unpin</strong></em> a tab from the top panel from
        the tab right click context menu.</p>


    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Just keep tabs <em>Pined</em> when you want quick access to them.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="artist list" class="manual-title">Artist List (Left side panel)</h3>

    <p>This layout lists artists from the current playlist. See <a
            href="https://github.com/Taiko2k/TauonMusicBox/wiki/Artist-list">here</a> for details.</p>

    <h3 id="folder navigator" class="manual-title">Folder Navigator (Left side panel)</h3>

    <p>This view lists folders in the current playlist.
    <p>

        <img src="t05.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the folder navigator">

    <p><strong>Double click</strong> a folder to play. <strong>Single click</strong> to simply locate that folder in the
        playlist.</p>


    <p>If there are sub-folders in your collection, this will be presented in a tree style layout.
        Note that this doesn't directly represent folders on your filesystem, but rather tries to intelligently list
        only relevant nodes of the folder structure of tracks you already imported.</p>


    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you have a large music collection, you <em>could</em> consider keeping your
            collection divided in separate sub-folders based on, for example, different genres. This will allow you to
            navigate your
            music collection more easily using the folder navigator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> In the <em>right click</em> context menu of a node level folder, there's an option
            named "Move playing folder here". Note that this is a <strong>physical</strong> move of
            the folder of the playing track to the selected folder on disk. The folder will be placed in an additional
            sub-folder that has the name of the <strong>artist</strong> of the album. (Folder will be created if it does
            not exist.)</p>

        <p>This feature is useful if you have multiple library locations you want to transfer albums between, or between
            different sub folders such as suggested in the above tip.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="search" class="manual-title">Global search</h2>

    <p>The global search complies different types of results from all playlists. It will automatically activate when you start
        typing.</p>

    <p>Clicking an Artist, Genre or Folder result will create a new playlist of that result. Clicking a Track or Album
        result will play it.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Right clicking</em></strong> any result will simply <strong>locate</strong> the result instead of
        playing or creating a new playlist. </p>
    <p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + clicking will add the result to the current playlist without closing the search.</p>

    <h2 id="find" class="manual-title">Quick find</h2>

    <p>The find box locates tracks within the <strong>currently viewed</strong> playlist only.</p>

    <p>To use the find box, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> and type search terms, then use UP or DOWN arrow keys
        to jump
        to the next or previous matching results in the playlist.</p>


    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to create a new playlist of all
            matching results.</p>

        <p>This can be useful for example, finding artists in features or filenames that may not be picked up by the
            global search.<br>
            Since this also searches the filename, you can use this to create a playlist of tracks of a single file
            type, for example searching <code>.ogg</code>
        </p>

    <h2 id="generators">Generator playlists (Smart / filter playlists)</h2>

    <p>Generator playlists allow you to create derivative playlists based on the content of another playlist. This is the
    main way of creating a filtered view of a playlist.</p>

    <p>You can quickly create a generated playlist from an existing playlist using the presets found under "Generate..." >
    from the playlist tab context menu.</p>

    <img src="t08.jpg" width="250px">

    <p>Once a generated playlist has been created, you can reload it by pressing "Regenerate" from its tab context menu.</p>

    <p>Whenever you create a new playlist using the <strong>global search</strong> or <strong>quick find</strong>, these
        will also be generator playlists that can be reloaded using the "Regenerate" function.
    </p>

    <p>You can manually create and edit generator playlists by selecting "Misc..." > "Edit generator..." from the playlist tab context menu.
        Generated playlists are made up of codes that you can use to create your own custom combination of searches, filters and sorters.
        See <a href="https://github.com/Taiko2k/TauonMusicBox/wiki/Generator-Codes" class="out-contents-link">here</a> for more details.

    <div class="tip">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> By default, you need to press "Regenerate" in order to reload these playlists, but its possible to have this done automatically, either
    globally by enabling the setting "Auto regenerate playlists", or for individual playlists by adding the generator code "auto".</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The general idea is that you import your music library to a single playlist that will be used as a source playlist,
    then you can create and remove generated playlists to create filtered/sorted views of your music.</p>

    </div>
