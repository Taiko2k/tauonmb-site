Tauon is a playlist oriented music player that makes the general assumption that folders are albums. You may find the words "album" and "folder" used interchangeably within the interface and documentation.

While some features and interface elements may not be immediately intuitive, once you are familiar with them, you will find that Tauon is pleasant, fast and fun to use!

## First Launch

When you launch Tauon for the first time you will be greeted with the main window:

The interface is divided into several key areas:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Main tracklist** | Where your tracks appear |
| **Top panel** | Playlist tabs |
| **Bottom panel** | Playback controls |
| **Right side panel** | Album art and metadata |
| **Left side panel** | Additional views (toggle from top-left corner) |

## Importing Your Music

To import tracks, simply **drag and drop** files or folders from your file manager into the main tracklist area.

:::tip
To get started, try importing all your music into a single playlist.

Once you have tracks imported, just **double click** them to play.

### Updating Your Library

Tauon has no background file monitoring. To update, simply clear the playlist and re-import.

Alternatively, you can trigger a rescan of all top level folders you've previously added by selecting "Rescan Folders" from the playlist tab context menu.
