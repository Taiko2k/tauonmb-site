---


**What platforms is Tauon for?**

Tauon is primarily designed for the Linux desktop. Builds also exist for Windows and macOS.

___

**What audio engine does this app use?**

It uses its own built in audio processor.

___

**Can this application handle large music collections?**

Tauon is intended to work well with ***medium*** to large music libraries. However, if you have a *huge* number of tracks, you may notice longer load times and degraded UI performance in some elements such as search.

There's no hard limit to the number of tracks you can import, but to give a ballpark number, it should handle at least up to ~50k tracks comfortably.

___

**What toolkit is this program using?**

It's using a custom GPU accelerated UI written in Python built upon SDL3.

___

**Amazing. Are there any reasons I wouldn't want to use this player?**

Maybe? Here are some reasons:

 - You want a player that organises your music for you.
 - You want an app that matches the visual style of your desktop environment. Tauon Music Box uses a custom user interface.
 - You want a player that handles importing millions of tracks.
 - You want a player that's ultra stable. Tauon can crash, maybe.
 - You want primarily a cloud streaming based player. Tauon has some support for this but it may not be robust.

___

**Can I load music from network folders?**

On Linux if you can mount the folder you can access it like any other filesystem. Network folders aren't supported on Windows.

This isn't necessarily the ideal way of doing it however. It might be better to run a music network server designed specifically for music such as [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/).

___

**Are HiDPI diplays supported?**

By default, Tauon will try detect an appropriate UI scale automatically. 

You can manually set the scaling Tauon uses by going `MENU` > `Settings...` > `Window` and adjusting the slider.


:::tip
If album art tends to look too small, consider enabling the setting `Zoom album art to fit` under `Settings...` > `View`.
:::

:::tip
If text in the tracklist seems vertically off-centre, consider tweaking the setting `Baseline offset` under `Settings...` > `Tracklist` to whatever looks visually best to you.

**Is high-res 24bit audio supported?**

Codec support is as follows:

| Codec | Preserve high resolution? | Preserve Samplerate? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FLAC, WavPack | Yes, 24bit supported | Yes with "Avoid Resampling" on* |
| MP3, OGG, OPUS | Only 16bit supported | Yes with "Avoid Resampling" on* |
| WAV, M4A, ALAC, APE, TTA, WMA | Downscaled to 16bit | No, may use resampling |

:::tip[Avoiding resampling on Linux]
To get samplerates forwarded to your DAC, enable setting "*Avoid Resampling*" in Tauon under MENU > Settings > Audio. You will also need to enable dynamic samplerates in your Pipewire configuration, see [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#Changing_the_allowed_sample_rate(s)) on how to do that. 

The downside of enabling *Avoid Resampling* is that fades will no longer occur between tracks of differing samplerates
