To enable, right click the right side panel album art and choose `Enable Milkdrop Visualiser`.

Middle click to toggle between square and wide aspect ratio.

Click the visualiser to change to a random one. You can toggle **auto advance** from the context menu.

### Installing presets:

If no presets are present you will be prompted to download a small curated preset pack. Otherwise, you can add your own presets by placing them in the preset folder. Presets must be in `.milk` "v1" format.

 - You can open the preset folder directly from the context menu.
 - You can drag and drop a `.milk` file directly into Tauon to load it immediately.

 There are a lot of presets out there on the internet but compatibility isn't perfect. Some may show artifacts or display as a black or white screen.
