To switch, **click the top corner panel button** to open the panel, then **right click** and choose *Artist List* from the menu.


## How it works

- **Click an artist to locate** their first appearance in the playlist.
    - Double click to play.
- A right click context menu allows you to create a new playlist for that artist.

    :::tip
    The artist list will stay linked to the original playlist, replacing the artist in the new playlist on further clicks.
    :::

- The playing artist will be located in the list when using **Go To Playing**.
- With the cursor over the artist list, pressing a letter on the keyboard will jump to the corresponding alphabetical position.

## Artist thumbnails

Images are sourced from last.fm. If an image was not loaded, a matching artist was likely not found. If an image was not successfully found, that artist will be blacklisted from further download attempts. You can reset this by selecting `MENU` > `Database....` > `Reset Image Cache`.

You can manually place artist images in the user data folder, inside a folder named `artist-pictures`. The name of the picture needs to match the artist name exactly, e.g. `Coldplay.jpg`, or `The Killers.png`.
