import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can import tracks from your [**PLEX**](https://www.plex.tv/), [**Jellyfin**](https://jellyfin.org/) or **Subsonic** compatible server such as [Airsonic](https://airsonic.github.io/) or [Navidrome](https://github.com/deluan/navidrome). (Funkwhale not supported).

## Connect Tauon to a server

<Steps>
1. Make sure your server is set up, running, and accessible.
2. In Tauon, go to `MENU` > `Settings` > `Accounts` and select the tab for your server type.
3. Fill in your account details, then click `Import music to playlist`.
</Steps>

:::note
Imported network tracks are stored in a playlist and **won’t auto-sync**. To refresh, right click the playlist tab and select `Regenerate`.

Server-side playlists are currently not supported.

On Linux (AUR), PLEX users may need to install `python-plexapi`.
:::

:::caution[Limitations]
- Having multiple source servers of the same type is **not supported**.
- If you switch or reset a server, remove any playlists containing tracks from that server type. To fully clean out network tracks, go to `MENU` > `Database...` > `Remove Network Tracks`.
- If Last.fm scrobbling is enabled in both Airsonic and Tauon, you’ll get double scrobbles. Disable scrobbling in either Airsonic or Tauon.
:::

:::tip[Nextcloud]
You can connect to **Nextcloud** using the Subsonic API via [Nextcloud Music](https://github.com/owncloud/music).

## Tauon remote playback

The ***Tauon Satellite*** feature lets you use Tauon as a network source itself! This function lets you import playlists from another running instance of Tauon Music Box on the same network.

### Limitations

- Only use on the same trusted LAN.
- Read-only: you can’t manage your collection remotely, only playback.

:::caution[Security]
This protocol is unauthenticated and unsecured. Only use it on a trusted network, and do not expose the port directly to the internet.
:::

### Set up

<Steps>
1. On the **source** PC, go to `MENU` > `Settings` > `Function` > `pg4` and enable **Remote control**.
2. Find the source computer’s IP address (on Linux, `ip a` can help).
3. On the **satellite** PC, go to `MENU` > `Settings` > `Accounts` > `Satellite` and enter the IP address (IP only, no protocol or port).
4. Enter the name of a playlist that exists on the source, then click **Get playlist** to import it.
