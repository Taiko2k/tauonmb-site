## Create a shuffled playlist

**Right click a playlist tab** and choose `Generate...` > `Shuffled Tracks`.

To limit the number of tracks in the playlist to 10, right click the new playlist, choose `Edit generator` and type the code `n10` to the end of the line (after a space).

You can then get a new set of shuffled tracks at any time by pressing `Regenerate`.

## Folder results

You can search for folder names in the global search.

You can right click any result to simply locate the result in the playlist.
