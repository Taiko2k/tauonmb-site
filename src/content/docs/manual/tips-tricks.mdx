## Create a shuffled playlist

**Right click a playlist tab** and choose `Generate...` > `Shuffled Tracks`.

To limit the number of tracks in the playlist to 10, right click the new playlist, choose `Edit generator` and type the code `n10` to the end of the line (after a space).

You can then get a new set of shuffled tracks at any time by pressing `Regenerate`.

## Folder results

You can search for folder names in the global search.

You can right click any result to simply locate the result in the playlist.

Useful if you have rectangular album and and and to admire it for all its beauty. I can't find any to show off here though. (Album on show is [Sunset Mountain by Geotic](https://geotic.bandcamp.com/album/sunset-mountain-eon-isle))

## Fix Japanese Mojibake

In case of [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake) (where displayed characters from Japanese language metadata is garbled), the ideal solution is to re-apply tags in a tag editor, preferably using UTF-8 if the tag format supports it.

As a quick temporary solution, a 'fix mojibake' function is available under:

`Track Menu` > `Meta...` > `Fix Mojibake`

This function will attempt to detect the original Japanese encoding and apply changes to all tracks in the folder/album.

:::note
Changes made by these functions only apply to internal database and are not written back to the tags on disk. You could write these back to disk using the "Edit fields..." function under "Meta...", but note that these *Japanese Mojibake* and *Edit Fields* functions don't work on all types of fields, so, fields such as *composer*, *comment* and *lyrics* would be left unmodified.
:::

:::tip
To undo these database changes and revert to original tags (provided you didn't select *write to disk*), use `Track Menu` > `Meta...` > `Reload Metadata`
