## Locating the user data file directory

If you'd like to access or backup Tauon's app data folder, you can locate it useing the "Open data folder" button under "MENU" > "Settings". Otherwise, here are some common paths:

| Platform  | Path |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Linux | `/home/<user>/.local/share/TauonMusicBox` |
| Flatpak  | `/home/<user>/.var/app/com.github.taiko2k.tauonmb/data/TauonMusicBox`  |
| Portable | `./user-data` |
| Windows | `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\TauonMusicBox` |

## Data files

There are two important files in this directory:

- `state.p` Contains playlists, track database information and settings.

- `star.p` Contains track play time and love information independent of the main database.

:::tip
If you want to backup or move installation, you can copy this user data folder. If you only care about keeping playcounts/loves/ratings, you only need to keep `star.p`.
:::

## Resetting the application

### Partial reset

Delete both the files `state.p` and `state.p.backup` and optionally `tauon.conf` (while app is closed). This will delete all playlists and reset most settings, but keeps track loves, play-counts and ratings.

### Full reset

Delete all the files and folders in this folder (while app is closed). All related player data will be lost unless backed up.

## Keeping track of playcounts

Playtimes are kept in the `star.p` file, along with the rating and whether a track is marked as loved. Tracks are uniquely identified by a matching **filename**, **artist** and **track title**.

Therefore in order to keep track of these, you must not change the filename outside of functions provided by Tauon Music Box. (You can use the `Reload Metadata` function to update tag information provided the filename has not changed)

:::tip
If you're moving installation and jsut want to keep playtimes, just make sure to copy the `star.p` file from the old program data folder to the new one.

## Recovering playcounts of an album

If you lose the playtimes of a particular album, you can try getting them back by using the `Vacuum Playtimes` feature available from the *folder title context menu* while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>. This function will take playtimes of any matching track in the database while **ignoring** the filename.
