:::tip[Organizing Your Collection]
If you have a large music collection, consider keeping it divided into separate sub-folders (e.g., by genre). This allows for easier navigation using the folder navigator.

:::caution[Move Folder Feature]
The context menu has a "Move playing folder here" option that performs a **physical** move of the folder on disk. The folder will be placed in a sub-folder named after the artist. Use with caution!
