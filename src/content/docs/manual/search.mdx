Tauon provides two ways to find music: **global search** and **quick find**.

## Global search

Global search compiles results from across all playlists. It automatically activates when you start typing.

### Search results

Global search returns results in multiple categories:

- **Artists**: all tracks by an artist
- **Albums**: all tracks from an album
- **Tracks**: individual tracks
- **Genres**: all tracks in a genre
- **Folders**: all tracks from a folder

### Actions

- Click an **Artist**, **Genre**, or **Folder** result → creates a new playlist of that result
- Click a **Track** or **Album** result → plays it
- Right-click any result → locates the result without playing or creating a playlist
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + click → adds the result to the current playlist without closing the search

## Quick find

Quick find searches within the **currently viewed playlist only**.

### Use quick find

<Steps>
1. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to open the find box.
2. Type your search terms.
3. Use the <kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys to jump to the previous/next match.
</Steps>

Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to create a new playlist of all matching results.

:::tip[Advanced uses]
Because quick find searches filenames, you can:

- Find artists in features that may not be picked up by global search
- Create a playlist of tracks of a single file type (for example, search `.ogg`)
:::

## Search tips

- Global search is best for discovering content across all playlists.
- Quick find is ideal for filtering the current playlist.
- Both search methods are case-insensitive.
