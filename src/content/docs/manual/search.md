---

Tauon provides two powerful ways to find music: global search and quick find.

## Global Search

The global search compiles different types of results from all playlists. It automatically activates when you start typing.

### Search Results

Global search returns results in multiple categories:
- **Artists** - All tracks by an artist
- **Albums** - All tracks from an album
- **Tracks** - Individual tracks
- **Genres** - All tracks in a genre
- **Folders** - All tracks from a folder

### Actions

- **Click** an Artist, Genre, or Folder result → Creates a new playlist of that result
- **Click** a Track or Album result → Plays it
- **Right click** any result → Locates the result without playing or creating a playlist
- **`Ctrl` + click** → Adds the result to the current playlist without closing the search

## Quick Find

The find box locates tracks within the **currently viewed playlist only**.

### Using Quick Find

1. Press `Ctrl` + `F` to open the find box
2. Type your search terms
3. Use `UP` or `DOWN` arrow keys to jump to the next or previous matching result

### Advanced Find

Press `Shift` + `Enter` to create a new playlist of all matching results.

:::tip[Advanced Uses]
Since find searches filenames, you can:
- Find artists in features that may not be picked up by global search
- Create a playlist of tracks of a single file type (e.g., search `.ogg`)
:::

## Search Tips

- Global search is best for discovering content across all playlists
- Quick find is ideal for filtering the current playlist
- Use quick find with `Shift` + `Enter` to create filtered playlist views
- Both search methods are case-insensitive
