description: View and fetch lyrics
---

You can view lyrics in either:

- The **right-side panel**
- The **Showcase + Lyrics** view

Both views have a **right-click** context menu with lyrics-related actions.

:::note
Tauon can display **Standard** (unsynced) lyrics and **Synced** lyrics. Synced lyrics can be edited in the [Lyrics Editor](lyrics-editor).
:::

## Standard Lyrics

Standard lyrics are shown when available. They are stored in the internal database and can be sourced from any of three types of locations:

- The audio file's metadata tags
   - These are automatically scanned when importing.
   - Use `Reload Metadata` to manually re-scan.
- `Search lyrics` (automatically fetch lyrics from the internet)
- `Paste Lyrics` (paste text from your system clipboard)

:::note
Clicking `Clear Lyrics` removes the shown standard lyrics from Tauon's internal database.
:::

### Substitute Lyrics Search

If lyrics need to be searched under a different name (e.g., to remove a featured artist), you can create a search substitution via the lyrics context menu > `Misc...` > `Substitute Search...`.

Edit values as needed, then click away to confirm. This will also apply to all songs with that original name in the future, not just the single one you clicked on.

:::caution
Substitutions apply globally: any track that matches the original name will use the new search terms.
:::

To remove a substitution, re-open the Substitute Search box and clear the field.

## Synced Lyrics

Synced lyrics highlight the currently active line in the lyrics and scroll automatically.

These lyrics are loaded from `.lrc` files, which need to be in the same location as the source audio file and have the same base filename in order to be detected. For example, have `clocks.mp3` and `clocks.lrc` in the same folder.

:::note
Synced lyrics are loaded when you play a track and are not stored in the internal database (unlike standard lyrics).
:::

:::tip
When both standard and synced lyrics are available, **Showcase + Lyrics** shows a button that lets you choose which type is preferred for display.
:::

The format of a `.lrc` file is made up of lines of lyrics with timestamps, with each line taking the format of `[mm:ss.ms]words` such as follows:

```text
[01:32.21]On my fears, on my loose ends
[01:38.99]All the strength leaves the ghosts alone
```
