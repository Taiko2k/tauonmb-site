## Modify Folder

Access the moddify folder box via either:

- Right-click a track → `Meta...` → `Modify Folder...`
- Right-click a folder title → `Modify Folder...`

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Rename** | Renames the folder using the template format you provide. |
| **Default** | Reverts the template to the built-in default. |
| **Trash** | Moves the physical folder to the system trash. Holding **Shift** deletes the folder directly (skips trash). |
| **Raise** | If the parent folder contains no other folders or files, moves the current folder up two levels and removes the now-empty parent. |
| **Clean** | Deletes common foreign/system files in the folder (e.g. `desktop.ini`, `Thumbs.db`, Windows Media Player thumbnail images, `.DS_Store`, `MACOSX`). |

:::caution
Although there are some checks in place, it's still possible to cause data loss. Avoid using these functions around files or folders you cannot afford to lose.

## Folder Relocate

This feature allows you to relocate a folder to another physical location on disk in your music library.

### How to use

1. Start playing a track from the folder you want to move.
2. In the **Folder navigator** panel, right-click a folder node and click `Move playing folder here`.

   The folder will be placed in an **artist name** subfolder. This artist folder will be created if it does not exist already.

:::tip
You can lock the folder navigator view to a playlist by selecting **Lock Panel** from the context menu. This allows you to transfer folders while browsing a different playlist.
:::

:::caution
This function moves data on disk. Use with caution and not around data you cannot afford to lose.

The **entire** source directory tree will be moved, so make sure it only contains folders and files you want to transfer.
