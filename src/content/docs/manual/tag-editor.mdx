import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This feature lets you edit metadata fields in Tauon’s local database, with the option to write changes back to the audio files on disk.

:::caution[Data loss risk]
If you don’t write changes to disk, you may lose associated playcount, rating, and love status if:

- You move files and then re-import.
- You reset Tauon by deleting its user data.
- You migrate to a new installation by only moving `star.p`.
- You edit tags of a network-based track (see below).
:::

:::note[Network sources]
Using this feature on network sources (for example Airsonic or Spotify) currently has no persistent effect because the data is reset when network tracks are re-imported.
:::

:::tip[Backups]
If you plan to make lots of edits without writing tags, periodically back up Tauon’s user data folder so your changes aren’t lost in case of corruption.

## How to use

<Steps>
1. Select `Edit Fields...` from any track menu.
2. Edit a field, then press **Enter** to apply the change.
3. Optional: click **WRITE TAGS** to save changes to the audio files. Otherwise changes remain in the local database only.
</Steps>
