:::note[Recommended]
Before importing playlists, it’s best to:

- Remove missing tracks: **MENU > Database > Remove Missing Tracks**
- Import the corresponding audio files first (so playlist entries can resolve)
:::

:::caution[Known issue]
Some tracks with unusual characters in their metadata may cause the import process to fail.
:::

:::tip
Exporting and then importing can also “revive” tracks after files have been moved.
