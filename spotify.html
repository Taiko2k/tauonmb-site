    <h1>Playback control for Spotify</h1>

    <p>To get started, follow instructions <a href="https://github.com/Taiko2k/TauonMusicBox/wiki/Spotify">here</a>
        to get setup. You will need a Spotify Premium account to be able to control playback. </p>

    <p>You will be able to import Spotify tracks to your playlists. Tauon will handle the transition between local
    and Spotify playback automatically.</p>

    <div class="tip">
        <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> You will need to keep another Spotify client open for actual playback of audio.</p>
    </div>


    <h2>Monitor and control a remote Spotify session</h2>

    <p>If playback is being directed from another application, you can begin monitoring playback by selecting <strong>"Start Spotify Remote"</strong> from MENU.</p>
